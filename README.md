# Billiard -2nck2-


This is a personal project of Nguyen Cong Kien. This will probably only last until the end of 2026.
The point of this project is just to make sure I have an fundamental base for development if I ever decide to work.

This `README.md` will serve as a personal log book, any meaningful update to the project will be stated here.

My initial list of feature that I currently have plan for:
- Implement different type/variation of billard such as 8-ball, 9-ball, maybe even some carom.
- A training area, where player can set the ball
- Replay system
- Clock / Timer
- Bots for difference variation
- 2D and 3D?
